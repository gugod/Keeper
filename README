# Keeper -- personal media stash.

    curl -F file=@file.png http://example.com/
    curl -XPOST http://example.com/ --data-binary @file.png

## Download / Hot-linking

The URL always looks like:

    curl http://example.com/$digest/$filename

## Check for existence

    /_exists/$digest
    200 OK - Object with $digest exitss
    404 NOT FOUNT - Otherwise

    curl -w '%{http_code}' http://example.com/_exists/$digest

The last part of the URL means "filename", an can be arbitrary. The following
URL means the same content:

    http://example.com/ZJC5o19CmYJMH9FUSYkP9dsSBLM/this.png
    http://example.com/ZJC5o19CmYJMH9FUSYkP9dsSBLM/that.png

Mordern browsers are generally smart enough to figure out what to do with
content with very little hint from URL/content. This software does not store or
manage the digest-to-filename mapping. The users os consuming program should
manage the mapping externally.

## INSTALL

The following config examples assumes the code runs from `/app/Keeper`, while
`/data/Keeper` is the directory for blob storage.

### nginx config: /etc/nginx/sites-available/keeper

    server {
        server_name example.com;
        listen 80;
        client_max_body_size 25m;
    
        root        /app/Keeper/public;
        location /blobs_store {
            internal;
            alias "/data/Keeper/store/blobs";
        }
        location / {
            try_files $uri @fallback;
        }
        location @fallback {
            include uwsgi_params;
            uwsgi_pass      unix:/run/uwsgi/app/keeper/socket;
            uwsgi_modifier1 5;
        }
    }

### uwsgi config: /etc/uwsgi/apps-available/keeper.ini

    [uwsgi]
    plugins = psgi
    file-serve-mode = x-accel-redirect
    app_code=/apps/Keeper
    psgi = %(app_code)/script/keeper
    env= MOJO_MODE=production
    env= MOJO_HOME=%(app_code)
    env= PERL5LIB=%(app_code)/lib:%(app_code)/local/lib/perl5
    env= KEEPER_BLOB_STORE_ROOT=/data/Keeper/store/blobs

Notice: The value of "uwsgi_pass" is absent from uwsgi config becasue it is
arranged by ubuntu package. You might need to add the following line to match
the value of uwsgi_pass in nginx conf:

    socket = /run/uwsgi/app/keeper/socket
